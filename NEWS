Noteworthy changes in 0.4.2
------------------------------------

     *	Raised the minimum perl level to 5.005,
	due to the use of Fatal.pm.


Noteworthy changes in 0.4.1
------------------------------------

    *	This version is NOT ENTIRELY BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE.
	Some functions, have changed names, namely
	those dealing with passphrases.

    *	cipher() and decipher() can take filehandles,
	and act like IPC::Open3.  One has control
	over the stdin, stdout, stderr, and the
	status filehandles.  Old functionality using
	passed array refs has been maintained, BUT WILL
	BE FADED OUT, in favor of the passed-filehandle
	method, as it is much more efficient with memory,
	and old code can be easily converted into
	using the new method.

    *	passphrase_test() is now smarter; it relies
	on the status fd from gpg to tell if
	as passphrase is good or not.

    *	passphrase_prompt() now uses Term::ReadKey to interact
	with the user.

    *	encrypt() and sign() are now aliases for encrypt().

    *	verify() and decrypt() are now aliases for decipher().

    *	Added data member $homedir.

    *	Major code rewrite; the whole internal structure changed.


Noteworthy changes in 0.3.3
------------------------------------

    *	Added NEWS file.

    *	Fixed problem with recipient ID's having spaces.

    *	Fixed documentation.

    *	One can now pass in anonymous hashes to the contructor
	to set data members upon creation.

    *	Clearsigning bug fixed.
